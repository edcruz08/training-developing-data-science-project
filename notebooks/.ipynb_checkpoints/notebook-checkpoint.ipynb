    "# 9. Visual Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual evaluation can often be more useful because your eyes find it easier to spot differences or issues better than when just looking at raw numbers. Here we're going to look at plotting a ROC curve, which is the number one way of visualising classifier performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other visualisations do exist and can be better in certain situations. For example, you wouldn't want to show this plot to a non-technical audience because of the unintuitive use of FPR and TPR metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you would use different plots to evaluation the performance of regression and clustering, all of which we don't have time to go into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, check out [scikit plot](https://github.com/reiinakano/scikit-plot) for some useful oneliners to do the same thing as we're doing below."
